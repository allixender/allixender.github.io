# Me doing so more stuff

I have a background in computer science and worked in the IT industry for several years. 
Then he decided to change paths slightly and graduated with a 
Master in Geographical Information Science and Systems at the Interfaculty Department for Geoinformatics (Z_GIS), 
University of Salzburg, Austria. In New Zealand I joined the GNS Science-led EU-NZ 
cooperative SMART Aquifer Characterisation Programme. In my PhD studies for the SMART 
research aim “Data Synthesis and Visualisation”, I aim to develop a web-based geospatial data sharing, 
processing and 3D/4D visualisation framework hydro(geo)logical datasets for New Zealand.

I'm blogging about more general aspects of my research [on Blogspot](http://allixender.blogspot.co.nz/).
