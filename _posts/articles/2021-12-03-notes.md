## Notes

One thing I am experiencing after a few days now is that while a few things are still slow, having both hands much more on the keyboard feels good.

There is something with Hibernate/Resume, that currently doesn't work, i.e. it doesn't resume aka doesn't load the hibernate state.
Suspend to RAM worked.

My swap dev is: /dev/nvme0n1p5, so resume=/dev/nvme0n1p5 ?

I had my first MS Teams and Zoom meeting under Linux with video and screensharing, something was off with my JBL cordless headset (it looked weird in the settings, but it worked), also my LogiTech web-cam.

I am getting used to keyboard shortcuts, that's nice. Having only immediate focus stuff on the current workspace seems to help not getting too much distracted.

NextCloud kept asking to grant access at each login, I realized I needed a wallet/keychain like tool. Although, having been a KDE fanboy I considered that XFCE4 is actually a GTK3+ framework and not QT like KDE. But you can start certain GNOME or KDE services at login time. So I did that and now gnome-keychain takes care of e.g. NextCloud tokens.

I keep installing additional stuff, such as more fonts (Inconsolata, Roboto, Nerdfonts), I have the Starship prompt active, but I didn't use Fish shell that much yet. Some unicode stuff still doesn't show correctly, I am not sure why:

A few of my main work habits come back to emailing, MS Office usage and File Explorer habits. This will have to play out over a longer time.

So far, I have used QGIS latest (not LTS from AUR) and Jupyter Lab without Miniconda, and it has been a breeze.

## Cooler same old tools?

I came across a nice [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/amilajack/status/1479328649820000256) on a bunch of cooler versions of the classic Linux/Unix command-line tools.

- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - a `cat` with syntax colouring etc
- [fx](https://github.com/antonmedv/fx) - a JSON parser, similar to `jq`
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) is `ls` but with coloring and re-written in Rust
- [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop) is nice `top` alternative

... and many more.

Exemplary, how to alias your `ls` usage with `exa`:

```bash
alias l='exa'
alias la='exa -a'
alias ll='exa -lah'
alias ls='exa --color=auto'
```

I didn't know before, there is even a [whole collection](https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/) of tools re-written in Rust.

Enjoy.
