## Abstract

The final sprint towards the end of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is over now. After fixing bugs, 
working on documentation and actually producing time-series in different formats, the “Exchangeable Encodings for SOS” 
project met most of its ambitious goals – and it is demonstrated on the 52°North Google summer of Code Demo Server. 
Users and developers documenation on the encoding mechanism has also found a place in the 52°North wiki.

We have integrated a plugin mechanism into an SOS server (source code branch), 
which is based on the main 52°North SOS development line (source code trunk).
