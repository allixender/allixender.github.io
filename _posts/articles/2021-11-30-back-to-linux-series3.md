## Actual work

My daily work consists of writing, geospatial data wrangling and modelling, and more varieties of writing or otherwise communicating.
Sometimes I like to fiddle with other tech stuff, such as web maps, SDI web services, API development.

I need more apps:

- MS Teams
- QGIS Desktop

Also, we have a network printing system, and of course Windows shares.

- Samba and smbmount, done
- [CUPS printing system](https://discovery.endeavouros.com/printers/printers/2021/03/)


## Nerd stuff

I got a bit carried away and installed more fonts and symbols and I am going to try:

- [Starship](https://starship.rs/): the cross-shell prompt for astronauts
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/): the friendly interactive shell

Probably both a waste of time for now, but hey, it might be nice.

## Also, backup

Admittently, I haven't done actual backups of my filesystems regularly, as most of my work stuff is either in GitHub, Google Cloud Buckets, Nextcloud or shared network drives. And privately I use Google Drive/Google One and NextCloud as well.

So, I thought ahead and configured my Linux system with BTRFS and hope to test Timeshift!

We'll see how that goes.
