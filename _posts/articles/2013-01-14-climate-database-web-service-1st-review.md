## Abstract

The first week before the break I spent some efforts to integrate my software development project 
into NIWAâ€™s software development process and environment. So it is ensured that once I have finished 
the eResearch project, the software can be maintained by NIWA staff afterwards. They also provide an 
elegant and robust development environment with the Eclipse IDE, source code revision management 
(Subversion), continuous integration (Jenkins) and testing. This shall ensure software quality and 
functionality being checked automatically with every code commit for everything that is developed 
within the research institute.
